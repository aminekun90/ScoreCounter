## How to install

Currently I dont have an apple developper account, but there is a solution you can use [AltStore classic](https://altstore.io) and add my source to download the app `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/aminekun90/7cc4885b56e0b0f1212db1ecf9c24369/raw/77d7ed4504db5a41b29770c65f452e1f6e5a05c8/altstore.json`
